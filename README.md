Brainstorm serves as a simple application where you can write down ideas. Each idea can have a name, and a description containing as much text as you want. Ideas can have sub-ideas (following the same data format), allowing you to expand upon your thoughts more categorically and structurally.

This is a fullstack project, consisting of a React front-end (hosted on Firebase) and a Java Spring + SQL Database back-end (hosted on Google Cloud).
